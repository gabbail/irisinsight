# IrisInsight

IrisInsight is a school project and a machine learning application for classifying iris flower species using a custom-built K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, implemented entirely from scratch without any external machine learning libraries. This project provides an educational exploration of AI principles and demonstrates the fundamentals of KNN through the well-known Iris dataset.

## Features

- **Custom KNN Classifier**: Implements the KNN algorithm without using any pre-built libraries.
- **Data Parsing**: Loads and processes the Iris dataset for classification.
- **Classification and Accuracy Testing**: Classifies iris species and evaluates accuracy metrics to validate the model.
- **Easy to Understand**: Built for simplicity and educational use, making it suitable for my portfolio and AI learning.
